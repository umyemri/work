# work

here i will be placing scripts and sql queries that function at least somewhat.

corrections will be made as i go along.

- immunization.R: converted a dta to csv, but with some issues. the initial 
    dataset had multiple row entries for the same patient. the epidemiologist 
    wanted one row per patient. which resulted in numerous columns. 
- immunization.py: [incomplete] same thing as above, just a python solution.
