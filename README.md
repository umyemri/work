# work

here i will be placing scripts and sql queries that function at least somewhat.

corrections will be made as i go along.

- immunization.R: converted a dta to csv, but with some issues. the initial 
    dataset had multiple row entries for the same patient. the epidemiologist 
    wanted one row per patient. which resulted in numerous columns. 
- immunization.py: [incomplete] same thing as above, just a python solution.
- immunization.sas: clean up file for the clean up file. i left some data in 
    the R sequence that made some garbage. so this is the correction (since 
    R is slow). not to mention i was working with a much smaller file.
